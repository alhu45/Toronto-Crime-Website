Designed and implemented a robust ETL pipeline to process Toronto Crime Data from January 2014 to September 2024.

Transformed data using PySpark to filter relevant records, reducing noise and optimizing efficiency, and stored it in a
MySQL database.

Created interactive visualizations in Tableau, including graphs and a detailed crime map of Toronto categorized by type and
frequency.

Developed a React-based frontend to dynamically display crime data, allowing users to explore incidents through an
interactive UI.
